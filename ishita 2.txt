Todays research shows that there are lots of urgency and security issues faced by common people.
Here we tried to built a user controlled system using Raspberry Pi and web camera . 
This system is kept in any remote location and is able to capture the environment in virtual form ,making the  user a vision that
he is actually present there by the output on his  headset to give him a full real time experience.
An added feature allows the camera to move in the direction of user's head movements to give him a full 360 degree experience.
We almost created a model for this using the previous python code by uploading it into the Raspberry Pi board and interfaced all the devices with the board.
Following is the block diagram for the  proposed model -
